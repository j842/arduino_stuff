Go to your Arduino install location (Not your My Documents\Ardunio) which is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries then make a new Folder called Music.  Then download and copy all the files and folders from this github into that new Music folder.  Then open your Ardunio IDE and go to File -> Examples and scroll towards the bottom you will see one called Music, open that one.  Then upload to your board and make sure your micro SD card is 2 GB or less and formatted in FAT (AKA FAT16) otherwise the mp3 shield wont recognize it.
